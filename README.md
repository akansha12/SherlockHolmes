## Sherlock Holmes

Although much of the work has been done until today to realize the Internet of Things (IoT) into practice, most of the work focuses on resource-constrained nodes, rather than linking the existing embedded systems to the Internet of Things (IoT) network. Recently many cases of missing children from infants to 12 years ,missing of women,old age people,cars or other devices are reported. In order to enhance security, a system is proposed to allow tracking of humans and devices from origin to destination. This project is about developing a tracking device using the concept of Internet of Things (IoT); now Internet of Things (IoT) is big support which will give platform to connect every device using the cloud, where different devices can connect with one single device through the channel of internet.

In this work we will use ARDUINO UNO R3 V1.0 as microcontroller at virtual level using proteus 7 tool and for GPS (Global Positioning System) we will use GPS module v1.0 and GSM SIM900D module. This device can easily do live tracking of any person and save themself by using this concept.


### Introduction

Project is focused on creating a virtual territory such that when someone crosses beyond, an automated notification is sent and a SOS button for emergency.


This project is about to develop a tracking device which can do live tracking of “children from infants to 12,women,old age people specially Alzheimer’s patients and animals and vehicles and valuable devices” by using the concept of  IoT.


This device allows its owner to set a range or boundary over an area for the client of the device.


If anyone wants to remove this device forcefully from client's body, it will send a tampering alert to the owner or parent' cell-phone.
This device will collect  the exact location of  any “thing” by using GPS and GSM module and send it to a server, so whenever their current location is demanded by the owner of the device, it will send a Google-map link along with latitude and longitude of the location on the cell-phone of the owner.
Whenever the clients cross the set boundary, the device will send an immediate alert on the cell-phone of the owner in the form of 'beep' and also start sending the  updated location of them continuously to the owner.


If the clients of the device found themselves in danger within the boundary or outside the specified boundary, they can press the 'SOS' button provided in the device and ask for immediate help.


Many types of smart devices are available in the world. Some devices for personal safety and some are for vehicle tracking. This project is design to be used in following situation:-
•	Parents can locate missing or lost women, girl and children.
•	This device is also helpful for old-age people especially the Alzheimer patients to stay in touch with their family members while they are away from home.
•	This device can also do the tracking of vehicles and locate them when they are lost or stolen. 
•	It will also help in reducing the problem of disappearance of ships in sea.
•	With the help of this device parents can also track their children while they are away from home and also they can keep an eye on them while they are using any vehicle.
•	In this propose device, one advance feature like SOS is available. It means in emergency case child or old women can press one single SOS button and ask for help from parents or person.

### Workflow 


### What is Proteus Software?

The Proteus is electronic circuit design software which includes a schematic capture, simulation and PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Layout modules.
Proteus ISIS is the best simulation software in the world for various designs with electronics & microcontroller. 
It is mainly popular because of availability of almost all microcontrollers in it. So it is a handy tool to test programs and embedded designs for electronics hobbyist & expert. You can simulate your programming of microcontroller in Proteus 8 Simulation Software.
After simulating your circuit using Proteus Software you can directly make PCB design with it so it could be an all in one package for students and hobbyists.
